A little Poem

Under keys, a hidden dance,

The silent magic of freelance.

 

In circuits, songs of zero-one,

A melody beneath the sun.

Subroutines in nested grace,

Unveil a web we interlace.

 

Call it code, or digital art,

Woven threads that never part.

From machine to human plea,

A symphony in binary.
